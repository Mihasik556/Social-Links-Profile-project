## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There`s not so much new things for me that I learned from this project, but some of them worth to mention. For example I liked how I maked buttons grow along with the card using flex grow properies.

```css
.smedia-links {
    display: flex;
    flex-grow: 1;
}

.link {
    display: block flex;
    flex: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

In future I will continue focusing on Mobile-First Workflow, making good semantic html code and writing better layouts using Flexbox.

### AI Collaboration

In this project I asked Claude for help a few times, I couldn`t understand the shortest way to make transition to all elements and AI gave me a good idea to make 'transition: all ...' to elements, divided by comma. Also I forgot if links can be changable in width, height or even in background things. Claude explained that i need to give link a 'display: block' to change their proportions.
